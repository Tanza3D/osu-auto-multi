# osu-auto-multi
automatically run through beatmap packs in an osu! multiplayer lobby

this was never quite finished, so each time you make a new multi you'll have to edit the code to specify which multiplayer room ID to join. you'll also need to get your api keys and such and fill them in manually.

i have no clue if this still works, i wrote it a good year ago and i'm just uploading it here for anyone who finds it useful
